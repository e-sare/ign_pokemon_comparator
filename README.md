This widget only runs on an older version of Safari, since it makes cross-domain
ajax calls to the Scala API. 
A few things to note:
- this repo only contains images of the widget ONLY!
- all the Pokemon image assets can be found under:
	https://github.com/ericsare/pokedex_frontend/tree/master/public/img/sugimori
- to correctly pull in all the Pokemon image assets, please go under battle_pokemon.js file and update the path wherever it calls a .png image.
